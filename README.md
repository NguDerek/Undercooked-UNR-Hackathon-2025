Authors: Gisselle Cruz-Robinson, Derek Ngu<br/><br/>
Description: A 2D cooking game inspired by Overcooked. Players can pick up ingredients, chop up vegetables, cook raw meat, and assemble ingredients together to create whole meals. The Ninja Adventure Asset Pack by pixel-boy was used for our project (https://pixel-boy.itch.io/ninja-adventure-asset-pack). This project was created in Unity.

# Gameplay
The controls are wasd or arrow keys to move the chef, and you use the e key to interact with objects. You can see what items your chef is holding, as well as what burger needs to be made. You can use the grey boxes to place down and pick up objects. There are also cutting boards and frying pans that need to be utilized while building your burger. In case if you have any unwanted items, there is a trash can in the lower right side of the map. The white box on the right is where the burgers are to be assembled.
